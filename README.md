## ControllerBuddy-Profiles

#### Description:
This repository contains a collection of profiles for the [ControllerBuddy](https://github.com/bwRavencl/ControllerBuddy) gamepad mapping software.  
All profiles were created by the author of ControllerBuddy and target a variety of flight simulators.  
Please note that these profiles are constantly updated and may change significantly over time.

#### Instructions:
- The `.json` files are ControllerBuddy profile files and can be loaded with said application.
- Inside the `configs` subfolder are game configuration files for use with the aforementioned profiles.
- If you are using a controller that is not a DualShock 4 or Dual Sense you will need to manually configure your game to ignore all inputs from your physical controller to prevent potential interferences with the input coming via ControllerBuddy and vJoy.
